# feather-rs getting started #

To begin, some explanatations are in order. feather-rs
is a modular system which uses three APIs in the core library, 
feather.rs.log, JSR-311/JAX-RS, and JSR-330/@Inject, which have
many implementations . So to start using feather-rs, 
we must choose implementations of all of these libraries.

## feather.rs.log ##

There is no logging JSR being used within feather-rs, just modules 
which implement the logging code. This is so that
additional modules of feather.rs have a logging API to use
that does not require a specific version of any logging implementation or API.

The following modules are available: 

	* log-simple - simple logging using System.out (used in examples)
	* log-slf4j15 - logging using slf4j-api version 1.5.X (preferred unless slf4j16 is required)
	* log-slf4j16 - logging using slf4j-api version 1.6.X (preferred unless slf4j15 is required) (TODO: implement)
	* log-log4j - logging using log4j (TODO: to implement)
	* log-jcl - logging using java commons logging (TODO: to implement)

## JSR-330 ## 

To use a JSR-330, simply follow the instructions for your preferred JSR-330
implementation. The following libraries are JSR-330 implementations:

	* Apache OpenWebBeans
	* JBoss Weld
	* Resin CanDI
	* Spring 3.0 (preferred, used in examples)
	* Google Guice
		
Which implementation you use for DI can change your JAX-RS choice,
especially outside of the JEE container. 

## JSR-311 ##

To use a JSR-311 implementation, simply follow the instructions for your preferred 
JSR-311 implementation. Also, you must verify that your JSR-311 implementation
can work with the chosen JSR-330 implementation. The following libraries
are JSR-311 implementations: 

	* Jersey (preferred, used in examples)
	* RESTEasy
	* Apache CXF
	* Restlet
