The current implementation of the validation code has two issues:

	1) The ValidationFactory is NOT a singleton.
	2) The Classpath can only support ONE javax.validation implementation. Having more than one 
	   implementation is undefined.

To change the JSR-303 validation implementation, we should
read a property file from `feather.rs.forms.validator`, which should
contain a canonical classname to the factory implementation. This will
fix #2.

This would be loaded once in a @Singleton @Named @Provider of type ContextProvider<ValidationFactory . 
This will fix #1
